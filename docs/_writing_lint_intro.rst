At this point we have a fairly a functional tool with test and help. This was
a pretty simple example - usually you will need to put more work into the tool
to get to this point - ``tool_init`` is really just designed to get you
started.

Now lets lint and test the tool we have developed. The planemo ``lint`` (or
just ``l``) command will reviews tools for obvious mistakes and compliance
with best practices.
