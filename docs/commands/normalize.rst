Generate normalized tool XML from input.

This will break the formatting of your tool and is currently only intended
for viewing macro expansions for for use with XSD validation (see
https://github.com/JeanFred/Galaxy-XSD for instance). Please do not use
the output as is - it frequently makes tool less readable not more.

The top-level blocks will be reordered and whitespace fixed according to
the tool development best practices outlined on the Galaxy wiki.
