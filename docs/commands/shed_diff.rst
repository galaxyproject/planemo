**Help**

diff between local repository and Tool Shed.

By default, this will produce a diff between this repository and what
would be uploaded to the Tool Shed with the `shed_upload` command - but
this command can be made to compare other combinations of repositories.
Here are some examples

::

    $ # diff for this repository and the main Tool Shed
    $ planemo shed_diff
    $ # diff for this repository and the test Tool Shed
    $ planemo shed_diff --shed_target testtoolshed
    $ # diff for the test Tool Shed and main Tool Shed
    $ planemo shed_diff --shed_target_source testtoolshed
    $ # diff for two an explicitly specified repositories (ignores
    $ # current project's shed YAML file.)
    $ planemo shed_diff --owner peterjc --name blast_rbh
        --shed_target_source testtoolshed

This command will return an exit code of:

- 0 if there are no detected differences.
- 1 if there are differences.
- 2 if the target repository doesn't exist.
- >200 if there are errors attempting to perform a diff.

**Warning:** ``shed_diff`` doesn't inspect repository metadata, this
difference applies only to the file contents of files that would actually be
uploaded to the repository.
