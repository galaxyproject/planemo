**Help**

Update Tool Shed repository.

By default this command will update both repository metadata
from ``.shed.yml`` and upload new contents from the repository
directory.

::

    % planemo shed_update

This will update the main tool shed with the repository defined
by a ``.shed.yml`` file in the current working directory. Both
the location of the ``.shed.yml`` and the tool shed to upload to
can be easily configured. For instance, the following command can
be used if ``.shed.yml`` if contained in ``path/to/repo`` and the
desire is to update the test tool shed.

::

    % planemo shed_update --shed_target testtoolshed path/to/repo

Another important option is ``--check_diff`` - this doesn't affect the
updating of shed metadata but it will check for differences before
uploading new contents to the tool shed. This may important because the
tool shed will automatically populate certain attributes in tool shed
artifact files (such as ``tool_dependencies.xml``) and this may
cause unwanted installable revisions to be created when there are no
important changes.

The lower-level ``shed_upload`` command should be used instead if
the repository doesn't define complete metadata in a ``.shed.yml``.
