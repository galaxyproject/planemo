==================================
Project Governance
==================================

This document informally outlines the organizational structure governing the
Planemo code base hosted at https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo. This
governance extends to code-related activities of this repository such as
releases and packaging and related Planemo projects such planemo-machine. This
governance does not include any other Galaxy-related projects belonging to the
``galaxyproject`` organization on GitHub.

Benevolent Dictator for Now (BDFN)
===================================

John Chilton (@jmchilton) is the benevolent dictator for now (BDFN) and is solely
responsible for setting project policy. The BDFN is responsible for maintaining
the trust of the developer community and so should be consistent and
transparent in decision making processes and request comment and build
consensus whenever possible.

The BDFN position only exists because the developers of the project believe it
is currently too small to support full and open governance at this time. In
order to keep things evolving quickly, it is better to keep procedures and
process to a minimum and centralize important decisions with a trusted
developer. The BDFN is explicitly meant to be replaced with a more formal and
democratic process if the project grows to a sufficient size or importance.

The *committers* group is the group of trusted developers and advocates who
manage the Planemo code base. They assume many roles required to achieve
the project's goals, especially those that require a high level of trust.

The BDFN will add committers as he or she see fits, usually after a few
successful pull requests. Committers may commit directly or merge pull
requests at their discretion, but everyone (including the BDFN) should open
pull requests for larger changes.

In order to encourage a shared sense of ownership and openness, any committer
may decide at any time to request a open governance model for the project be
established and the BDFN must replace this informal policy with a more formal
one and work with the project committers to establish a consensus on these
procedures.
