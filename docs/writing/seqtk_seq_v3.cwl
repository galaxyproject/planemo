  Usage:   seqtk seq [options] <in.fq>|<in.fa>
  
  Options: -q INT    mask bases with quality lower than INT [0]
           -X INT    mask bases with quality higher than INT [255]
           -n CHAR   masked bases converted to CHAR; 0 for lowercase [0]
           -l INT    number of residues per line; 0 for 2^32-1 [0]
           -Q INT    quality shift: ASCII-INT gives base quality [33]
           -s INT    random seed (effective with -f) [11]
           -f FLOAT  sample FLOAT fraction of sequences [1]
           -M FILE   mask regions in BED or name list FILE [null]
           -L INT    drop sequences with length shorter than INT [0]
           -c        mask complement region (effective with -M)
           -r        reverse complement
           -A        force FASTA output (discard quality)
           -C        drop comments at the header lines
           -N        drop sequences containing ambiguous bases
           -1        output the 2n-1 reads only
           -2        output the 2n reads only
           -V        shift quality by '(-Q) - 33'
           -U        convert all bases to uppercases
