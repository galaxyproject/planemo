Building Common Workflow Language Tools
=======================================

The following links are for the same tutorial describing the basics of how to
build `Common Workflow Language`_ tools. The first variant is tailored to local
development environments (e.g. if Planemo has been installed with ``brew`` or ``pip``) and
the second is for developers using a dedicated Planemo `virtual appliance
<https://planemo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/appliance.html>`_ (available for
Docker_, Vagrant_, etc...).
